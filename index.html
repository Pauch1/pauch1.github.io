                        Hello! I'm Paulo, a freshman IT student at Mindoro State University. I'm embarking on an
                        exciting journey into the world of technology and computer science, where I'm eager to explore a
                        wide range of topics from software development to cybersecurity.
                    </p>
                        As a newcomer to the field, I'm particularly fascinated by Chatbot technology(e.g. chatgpt),
                        web programming and software development. Im passionate about understanding how
                        technology can solve real-world problems and enhance our daily lives. My academic focus is on
                        learning and mastering various programming languages such as python, javascript, react, 
                        ruby, and Im excited about applying my learning topractical challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my summer vaction, I,ve had the motivation to start and learn various programming
                        languages like python and c. I have build projects that incorporate what i have
                        learn in these countless tutorial i have watch. These experiences have honed my problem-solving
                        skills and provided me with a solid foundation in coding and problem-analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing mobile games, reading novel and watching youtube or tiktok.
                        I find inspiration in a youtuber name michael reeves, he is a tech youtuber who made incredible but not so usefull
                        stuff, he add humor to his video and was funny guy. He create a video not for money or content, he create
                        video because he genuinly like it. And just like him i want to create project that i want to, intergrate
                         technology in my daily life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the field of IT, and I'm eager to connect with
                        others who share my passion. Create a wonderful memory and a strong bond with them
                    </p>
